# üîê Amazon Connect Security & Compliance Checklist

### ‚úÖ 1. **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**

* [ ] Use **IAM roles** for Lambda, Kinesis, S3 instead of long-term keys.
* [ ] Apply **least privilege policies** (e.g., agents only need Connect APIs, not full S3).
* [ ] Enable **MFA** for supervisors/admins.
* [ ] Separate **dev/test/prod IAM roles** with permission boundaries.
* [ ] Rotate secrets using **AWS Secrets Manager** (for CRM API keys).

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Encryption (KMS & TLS)**

* [ ] Enable **KMS encryption** for:

  * S3 buckets (call recordings, transcripts).
  * DynamoDB tables (customer profiles).
  * CloudWatch logs (sensitive data in traces).
* [ ] Use **customer-managed CMKs** with key rotation.
* [ ] Force **TLS 1.2+** for all API traffic.
* [ ] Apply **bucket policies** to prevent unencrypted uploads.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Data Privacy & GDPR**

* [ ] Store EU customer data in **EU regions only** (Frankfurt, Ireland).
* [ ] Build **data deletion workflows** (Lambda to delete recordings/CTRs on request).
* [ ] Apply **least data retention** (delete recordings older than policy allows).
* [ ] Anonymize or mask sensitive data in CTRs and logs.
* [ ] Provide **audit reports** for customer deletion requests.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **PCI DSS (Payments)**

* [ ] Use **DTMF masking** ‚Üí Agents cannot hear card numbers.
* [ ] Pause/resume **call recordings** during payment capture.
* [ ] Send card details **directly to payment processor API**, not stored in CTRs/S3.
* [ ] Apply **network segmentation** (separate PCI workloads from non-PCI).
* [ ] Document **annual PCI compliance checks**.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **HIPAA (Healthcare Use Cases)**

* [ ] Use **HIPAA-eligible AWS services** only (Amazon Connect, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, etc.).
* [ ] Sign a **BAA (Business Associate Agreement)** with AWS.
* [ ] Encrypt **PHI** with KMS (customer-managed key).
* [ ] Restrict **access logging** for PHI storage buckets.
* [ ] Ensure **audit logging** via CloudTrail (who accessed patient data).

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Monitoring & Auditing**

* [ ] Enable **CloudTrail** for all Connect, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda actions.
* [ ] Use **CloudWatch Alarms** for failed API calls or suspicious activity.
* [ ] Stream CTRs & logs to **Kinesis ‚Üí QuickSight** for compliance dashboards.
* [ ] Configure **GuardDuty** for anomaly detection (unusual agent behavior).
* [ ] Integrate with **Splunk/Datadog** for centralized monitoring.

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **DevOps & Governance**

* [ ] Deploy environments with **Terraform/CloudFormation/CDK**.
* [ ] Apply **linting & compliance checks** (e.g., `cfn-nag`, `tfsec`) in CI/CD.
* [ ] Automate **secrets rotation** for CRM integrations.
* [ ] Define **backup & disaster recovery** (cross-region S3 replication).
* [ ] Document **RACI roles** (who can access prod vs test).

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **Compliance Certifications**

* [ ] Ensure solution aligns with **SOC 2 Type II** (Amazon Connect is SOC compliant).
* [ ] Maintain **evidence** of GDPR/PCI/HIPAA compliance for audits.
* [ ] Train support staff on **security awareness & compliance handling**.

---

‚ö° **Tip for Interviews & Hands-on Work**:
When asked about security/compliance, *always tie back to*:

1. **IAM (who can access)**
2. **KMS (how data is protected)**
3. **Compliance laws (GDPR, PCI, HIPAA)**
4. **Monitoring & auditing (CloudTrail, CloudWatch, GuardDuty)**
