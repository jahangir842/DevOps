❌ Stop memorizing definitions for your cloud/DevOps interviews. 
Here are 10 questions you must ask yourself before any serious interview

✔️ Can I sketch how this app works in the cloud?
👉 If you can't draw it, you don't understand it. Architecture diagrams > bullet points. Bonus: Try sketching VPC, ALB, EC2, RDS flow on paper.

✔️ Do I understand cost trade-offs in my design?
👉 S3 is cheap, NAT Gateway is expensive. Multi-region = resilient and $$. Can you justify your design's monthly bill?

✔️ How do I secure this architecture?
👉 It's more than just HTTPS. Ask yourself: Who can access it? Where are the secrets stored? What roles/policies are involved? Think: IAM, Security Groups, KMS, Secrets Manager.

✔️ What's the blast radius of your architecture?
👉 Can a misconfigured deploy kill the entire app? Affect all users? Cause data loss? Think fault domains, scopes, retries, limits.

✔️ Where's your single point of failure?
👉 If a single resource or zone goes down - what breaks? What alerts? What auto-heals? Bonus: Answer this without saying "we have backups."

✔️ How do you manage secrets securely?
👉 Hardcoded creds = instant fail. Use Secrets Manager, Key Vault, Vault. No secrets in Git. Rotate regularly. Least privilege always.

✔️ What's your monitoring and alerting strategy?
👉 Don't say "CloudWatch + email." Think: What metrics matter (business + infra)? What's noisy? Where's the dashboard? Is there an on-call plan?

✔️ How do you secure networking between services?
👉 Not everything should talk to everything. Use SGs/NACLs/IAM policies. TLS everywhere. Private subnets. Service meshes if needed.

✔️ Can this scale to 1 million users?
👉 What breaks at 1k, 10k, 100k? API gateway limits? DB connection pool? VPC NAT bottlenecks? Throttling or retries?

✔️ How do you tag & organize resources?
👉 Unsexy but critical. Tags help with cost tracking, cleanup, ownership, and automation.

They test how you think, design, and react in chaos.
