Sure! Below is an **Ansible playbook** that will help you automate the setup of a **GitHub Actions self-hosted runner** along with periodic cleanup of the workspace.

This playbook will:
1. Install the GitHub Actions self-hosted runner.
2. Set up the runner as a service.
3. Configure a **cron job** for periodic cleanup of the workspace (e.g., weekly).

### Explanation of the Playbook:

1. **Install Required Packages:**
   - This installs `curl`, `jq`, and `wget` to download and set up the GitHub Actions runner.

2. **Download GitHub Actions Runner:**
   - Downloads the latest version of the GitHub Actions runner package.
   - Extracts the package to `/home/github-runner/actions-runner`.

3. **Create User for GitHub Runner:**
   - If the `github-runner` user doesn't exist, it will be created with the specified home directory.

4. **Configure GitHub Runner:**
   - This step configures the runner with your GitHub organization/repository using a runner token.
   - You'll need to pass the `runner_token` as a variable or store it securely in a Vault/secret management solution.

5. **Install GitHub Runner as a Systemd Service:**
   - The runner is installed as a systemd service, and it will be automatically started.

6. **Set Up Periodic Cleanup:**
   - A **cron job** is scheduled to run weekly (on Sundays at 3 AM) to invoke the `post-job.sh` cleanup script.
   - This script will delete any old workspace files to prevent the runner directory from accumulating unnecessary data.

7. **Post-Job Cleanup Script:**
   - The script `/home/github-runner/actions-runner/.github/hooks/post-job.sh` will be created to handle the cleanup of the `_work` directory after each job is completed. It will clear the directory to keep the runner environment clean.

---

### üí° Customization:

- **Runner Token**: You‚Äôll need to set up a **GitHub personal access token** (or use GitHub's authentication) for the runner during the configuration step. This should be securely passed into the playbook via variables or secrets.
  
- **Cron Frequency**: The cron job is set to clean up weekly (`minute: "0"`, `hour: "3"`, `day: "0"`). Adjust the timing if needed (e.g., daily, monthly).

- **GitHub URL**: Replace `<YOUR_ORG>/<YOUR_REPO>` with your specific repository or organization URL.

---

### How to Run the Playbook:

1. Save this playbook to a file, e.g., `setup_github_runner.yml`.
2. Run the playbook with Ansible:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook setup_github_runner.yml -e "runner_token=YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN"
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN` with the actual GitHub runner token you generated in your repository settings.
